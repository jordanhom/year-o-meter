# Active Context - Year-O-Meter

**Current Goal:** Implement UX Refinements

**Current Task:** Prepare to implement the high-priority UX refinements identified by Dr. Reed.

**Recent Changes:**
*   Established initial Memory Bank files based on existing `time_left.html`.
*   Renamed project to "Year-O-Meter".
*   Received UX review feedback from Dr. Reed.
*   Created `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md` detailing actionable tasks from the review. (NEW)
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reference the new guide. (NEW)

**Next Action:**
1.  Begin implementing the **High Priority Tasks** listed in `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md`, starting with Accessibility items (Color Contrast, Grid Semantics, Live Regions) and the Page Title update.
2.  Update `progress.md` and this file as tasks are completed.

**Blockers:** None.

**Relevant Files Recently Modified/Created:**
*   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (Updated project name)
*   `memory-bank/productContext.md` (Updated project name)
*   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (Updated project name)
*   `memory-bank/techContext.md` (Updated project name)
*   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (This file - Updated)
*   `memory-bank/progress.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md` (Created) (NEW)
*   `time_left.html` (Source for documentation, target for upcoming changes)

**Open Questions/Decisions:**
*   Should the code be refactored out of the single HTML file into separate CSS and JS files/modules *before* or *after* implementing the UX refinements? (Refactoring first might make applying changes easier).

**Learnings & Insights:**
*   The initial `time_left.html` represents a functionally complete version of the core concept.
*   A structured UX review identified key areas for improvement, particularly in accessibility.
*   Documenting actionable tasks in a dedicated guide (`ux-refinement-guide.md`) provides a clear roadmap for implementation.
