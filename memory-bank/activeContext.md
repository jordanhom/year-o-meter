# Active Context - Year-O-Meter

**Current Goal:** Implement UX Refinements

**Current Task:** Prepare to implement the high-priority UX refinements identified by Dr. Reed.

**Recent Changes:**
*   Established initial Memory Bank files based on existing `time_left.html`.
*   Renamed project to "Year-O-Meter".
*   Received UX review feedback from Dr. Reed.
*   Created `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md` detailing actionable tasks from the review.
*   Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reference the new guide.
*   **Refactored the project:** Split the single `time_left.html` file into separate `index.html`, `css/style.css`, and `js/main.js` files. (NEW)
*   Updated `README.md` to reflect the refactoring. (NEW)
*   Updated Memory Bank files to reflect the refactoring. (This update) (NEW)

**Next Action:**
1.  Begin implementing the **High Priority Tasks** listed in `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md`, starting with Accessibility items (Color Contrast, Grid Semantics, Live Regions) and the Page Title update (already partially addressed in `index.html`).
2.  Update `progress.md` and this file as tasks are completed.

**Blockers:** None.

**Relevant Files Recently Modified/Created:**
*   `index.html` (Created from refactor)
*   `css/style.css` (Created from refactor)
*   `js/main.js` (Created from refactor)
*   `README.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/productContext.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/techContext.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (This file - Updated)
*   `memory-bank/progress.md` (Updated)
*   `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md` (Updated)
*   `time_left.html` (Deleted)

**Open Questions/Decisions:**
*   ~~Should the code be refactored out of the single HTML file into separate CSS and JS files/modules *before* or *after* implementing the UX refinements?~~ (Decision: Refactoring completed *before* UX refinements).

**Learnings & Insights:**
*   Refactoring into separate files improves code organization and maintainability, making future changes (like UX refinements) easier to manage.
*   The `defer` attribute on the `<script>` tag in `index.html` is crucial for ensuring the DOM is ready before the script runs.
