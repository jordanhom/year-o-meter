# Active Context - time_left_this_year

**Current Goal:** Establish Baseline Documentation

**Current Task:** Create initial Memory Bank files based on existing `time_left.html`.

**Recent Changes:**
*   N/A (This is the initial documentation setup based on pre-existing code).

**Next Action:**
1.  Review the newly created Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) for accuracy and completeness against `time_left.html`.
2.  Consider potential next steps for the project (e.g., refactoring into separate files, adding features, addressing potential improvements).

**Blockers:** None.

**Relevant Files Recently Modified/Created:**
*   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (Created)
*   `memory-bank/productContext.md` (Created)
*   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (Created)
*   `memory-bank/techContext.md` (Created)
*   `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (This file - Created)
*   `memory-bank/progress.md` (Created)
*   `time_left.html` (Used as source for documentation)

**Open Questions/Decisions:**
*   Should the code be refactored out of the single HTML file into separate CSS and JS files/modules for better organization?
*   Are there any immediate bugs or improvements needed based on the initial code review during documentation?

**Learnings & Insights:**
*   The initial `time_left.html` represents a functionally complete version of the core concept described.
*   The JavaScript within the single file demonstrates logical separation of concerns (state, DOM, calculations, rendering, events).
*   The grid rendering optimization (DOM build vs. class update) is a key performance pattern implemented.
