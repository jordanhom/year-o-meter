# Progress Log - Year-O-Meter

## Initial State - Functionally Complete / UX Refinements Pending

**Status:** The application, as implemented in `time_left.html`, is functionally complete according to the features observed and documented in `projectbrief.md`. A comprehensive UX review by Dr. Reed has identified critical refinements needed before the application meets desired quality standards.

**Completed Tasks (Inferred from `time_left.html` & Initial Setup):**

*   **Core Display:** Implemented (Date/Time, Countdown, Progress Bar).
*   **Calculations:** Implemented (Time remaining, Progress %, Leap Year).
*   **Optional Features:** Implemented (Milliseconds, Seasonal Styling, Year Grid, Circles, Holidays, Solstice).
*   **User Interface:** Implemented (Layout, Styling, Collapsible Options, Responsive Design).
*   **Technical:** Implemented (Dynamic Updates, Comments).
*   **Documentation:** Initial Memory Bank created, project renamed to Year-O-Meter.
*   **UX Review:** Completed by Dr. Reed. Actionable tasks documented. (NEW)

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Implement UX Refinements:** Address the tasks outlined in `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md`, prioritizing the High Priority items related to accessibility and core usability. (NEW)
2.  **Code Review (Optional but Recommended):** Perform a detailed review of the existing code in `time_left.html` for potential bugs, improvements, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
3.  **Refactoring (Consideration):** Evaluate splitting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, potentially other JS modules) for better maintainability and organization. This could be done before or after the UX refinements.

**Out of Scope (Potential Future Ideas):**

*   User accounts or data persistence.
*   Saving user preferences for options.
*   Support for different locales (holiday calculations, date/time formatting beyond browser defaults).
*   Configurable grid layouts or color schemes beyond seasonal.
*   Backend integration or data fetching.
*   Implementing a build process/bundling.
*   Adding unit tests.
