# Progress Log - Year-O-Meter

## Current State - Refactored / UX Refinements Pending

**Status:** The application is functionally complete according to the features documented in `projectbrief.md`. The codebase has been refactored from a single HTML file into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for improved maintainability. A comprehensive UX review by Dr. Reed has identified critical refinements needed before the application meets desired quality standards.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   **Core Display:** Implemented (Date/Time, Countdown, Progress Bar).
*   **Calculations:** Implemented (Time remaining, Progress %, Leap Year).
*   **Optional Features:** Implemented (Milliseconds, Seasonal Styling, Year Grid, Circles, Holidays, Solstice).
*   **User Interface:** Implemented (Layout, Styling, Collapsible Options, Responsive Design).
*   **Technical:** Implemented (Dynamic Updates, Comments).
*   **Documentation:** Initial Memory Bank created, project renamed to Year-O-Meter.
*   **UX Review:** Completed by Dr. Reed. Actionable tasks documented in `ux-refinement-guide.md`.
*   **Refactoring:** Split single `time_left.html` into `index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`. (NEW)
*   **Documentation Update:** Updated `README.md` and Memory Bank files post-refactoring. (NEW)

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Implement UX Refinements:** Address the tasks outlined in `memory-bank/ux-refinement-guide.md`, prioritizing the High Priority items related to accessibility and core usability.
2.  **Code Review (Optional but Recommended):** Perform a detailed review of the refactored code (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`) for potential bugs, improvements, clarity, and adherence to best practices, especially before or after UX refinements.

**Out of Scope (Potential Future Ideas):**

*   User accounts or data persistence.
*   Saving user preferences for options.
*   Support for different locales (holiday calculations, date/time formatting beyond browser defaults).
*   Configurable grid layouts or color schemes beyond seasonal.
*   Backend integration or data fetching.
*   Implementing a build process/bundling.
*   Adding unit tests.
