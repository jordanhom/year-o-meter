# Progress Log - time_left_this_year

## Initial State - Functionally Complete (Based on `time_left.html`)

**Status:** The application, as implemented in `time_left.html`, is functionally complete according to the features observed in that file and documented in `projectbrief.md`. All described features (countdown, progress, optional grid, seasonal themes, options panel) are working.

**Completed Tasks (Inferred from `time_left.html`):**

*   **Core Display:**
    *   Dynamic Date/Time display implemented.
    *   Dynamic Countdown (D/H/M/S) implemented.
    *   Dynamic Progress Bar implemented.
*   **Calculations:**
    *   Time remaining calculation implemented.
    *   Year progress percentage calculation implemented.
    *   Leap year handling implemented (`isLeapYear` function used for grid/progress).
*   **Optional Features:**
    *   Milliseconds display toggle implemented (affects time/countdown and update interval).
    *   Seasonal styling toggle implemented (applies CSS classes based on `getSeason`).
    *   Year Grid display toggle implemented.
    *   Grid rendering logic (30x13 layout) implemented with past/today/future coloring.
    *   Grid optimization (build once, update classes) implemented.
    *   Grid Circles toggle implemented (adds `.circles` class).
    *   Grid Holidays toggle implemented (calculates US holidays via `getHolidays`, applies `.holiday` class).
    *   Grid Solstice toggle implemented (uses approximate dates from `getSolsticeDays`, applies `.longest-day`/`.shortest-day` classes).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Layout structured in HTML.
    *   Styling applied via embedded CSS.
    *   Collapsible "Extra Options" section implemented with working toggles.
    *   Dependent grid options correctly enabled/disabled.
    *   Tooltips (`title` attribute) added to grid day blocks.
    *   Responsive design implemented via CSS media queries.
*   **Technical:**
    *   Dynamic updates via `setInterval` implemented, with adjustable frequency.
    *   Code includes comments explaining logic.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Review Documentation:** Verify the accuracy and completeness of the newly created Memory Bank files.
2.  **Code Review (Optional but Recommended):** Perform a detailed review of the existing code in `time_left.html` for potential bugs, improvements, clarity, and adherence to best practices.
3.  **Refactoring (Consideration):** Evaluate splitting the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, potentially other JS modules) for better maintainability and organization.
4.  **Future Enhancements:** Consider items listed as "Out of Scope" in `projectbrief.md` or identify new features based on review.

**Out of Scope (Potential Future Ideas):**

*   User accounts or data persistence.
*   Saving user preferences for options.
*   Support for different locales (holiday calculations, date/time formatting beyond browser defaults).
*   Configurable grid layouts or color schemes beyond seasonal.
*   Backend integration or data fetching.
*   Implementing a build process/bundling.
*   Adding unit tests.
